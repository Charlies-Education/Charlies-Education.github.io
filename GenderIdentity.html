<h2>The Trans Umbrella</h2>
<h4>There are many, many different gender identities that could be labled under the trans umbrella. Technically, "trans" is just someone who does not consider themleves to be cis, so you could consider all identities besides cis and/or sometimes intersex to go under this umbrella. More commonly though, you can see a smaller, nonbinary umbrella to describe identities like agender or genderfluid.</h4>

<br></br>

<h2>Gender vs sex</h2>
<h4>Gender Identity and sex are very important to distinguish, especially if you want to be able to support someone whos gender identity is different from their born sex. </h4>
<br></br>
<h4>One of the biggest "arguments" that transphobes use is how someone will never be a real man or woman because of their genitailia or how "they'll never be able to have kids" as if thats what makes you a man or woman. Which, it doesnt. A cis woman may be infertile, but shes still a woman. A trans woman may not be able to get pregnant, but it does not make her any less of a woman. </h4>
<br></br>
<h4>Another argument they'll make is about gender reassignment surgery. "Why would you need a surgery if you're truely a man/woman?" Please understand that while this question can be just an inquisitive one, it has also been used against me and other people I know with malicious intent. The answer to this question, though, is that it makes us confident. It makes us feel more like ourselves, and it is done with no intent of other peoples perceptions.</h4>
