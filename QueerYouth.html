<h3>Introduction</h3><p>Many young people in the coming generations are seeming to struggle with their identity, whether it be sexuality or gender. This page should help you and others understand on a deeper level about the different options that you have. And dont worry: This is a queer website made by a queer person!</p></center></div>

<h3>Why visit this webite?</h3>
<p>While it is true that you are able to look all of this up, having it all condensed in one website is the most convenient way to do a small amount of research quickly. Or if it's just for fun, you are able to visit this website and scroll through the pages; maybe someone comes out to you, and you want to know how to support them. You should always find multiple websites, but on a quick and easy-to-navigate website you can get fast support tips for your queer friend.</p>

 <br></br>

<h3>How to Navigate</h3>
<p>When you first open up my website, you may be a little overwhelmed at first. But, lucky for you, its pretty easy to navigate! Do you see the bar at the top of your screen? You can click on any of the sections. You will know which one your mouse is hovering over because of the slight change in hue between the other backgrounds. On both the sexuality and gender Identity pages, you will find undefined terms under the flags with definitions. These are umbrella terms, or more 'backhand' terms not as commonly used. (Keep in mind these are still as valid as the rest.) Clicking on these terms will bring you to a website that goes into further detail about the term. All of them come from the websites below. Off the topic of links, on some pages you may find that you can scrool over a phot and it will have text appear. This is an intentional mechanism that makes the space more orgainized. Please take your time to read anything you're interested in, and I hope you may find this website useful.</p>
 <br></br>

<h3>Additional Resources</h3>
<p>While there are only so many things I can do as a student, there are many other websites out there to help you with your or your peers' discovery journey. I would recommend <a href="https://library.lgbt/" target="_blank">library.LGBT</a>, or <a href="https://www.lgbtqia.wiki/wiki/LGBTA_Wiki" target="_blank">LGBTQIA+ Wiki</a>. They both offer far more extensive research than I could ever do, and have almost every flag in between the two. Overall, I highly recommend checking these two resources out if you have no intention of looking at mine.</p>
